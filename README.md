**Note:** This is not production-ready software.

This project is a **purely educational** project where I am learning the **WinAPI** and **DirectX**.

Most of the code has been inspired by or directly attributed to **ChiliTomatoNoodle's C++ 3D DirectX Tutorial** on YouTube. You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqCJpWy5Fohd3S7ICFXwUomYW0Wv67pDD).

> **Disclaimer:** I take no credit for any of the code in this project.
